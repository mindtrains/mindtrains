MindTrains
==========

Write a computer program by building a model train track!


MindTrains.jar is an executable jar so, as long as you have Java (1.4 or above)
installed, you should be able to double click on it, or run:

   java -jar MindTrains.jar


Known issues:

   docs doesn't contain any (useful) docs
   you can't delete any track (except by editing docs/saved.xml)
   changes to the entry point aren't saved
